      "1. Import the necessary packages:\n",

      "from pyECSS import System\n",
      "from pyGLV import RenderMesh, BasicTransform\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Create a new class for your animation system that inherits from the `System` class:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "class CharacterAnimationSystem(System):\n",
      "    def __init__(self):\n",
      "        super().__init__()\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Implement the `update` method in your system class. This method will be called every frame to update the character's animation:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "    def update(self, dt):\n",
      "        # Get all entities with the required components\n",
      "        entities = self.get_entities_with_components(RenderMesh, BasicTransform)\n",

      "\n",
      "            # Perform animation calculations and update the render mesh and transform properties accordingly\n",
      "            # Example:\n",
      "            render_mesh.animation_frame += 1\n",
      "            transform.rotation += 0.1\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Create an instance of your animation system and add it to your pyECSS scenegraph:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "animation_system = CharacterAnimationSystem()\n",
      "scene.add_system(animation_system)\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Run your pyECSS scenegraph update loop to continuously update the animation:\n",
